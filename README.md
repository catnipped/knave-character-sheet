# KNAVE Character Sheet

![preview image][preview]

I made this character sheet for [Knave RPG](https://questingbeast.itch.io/knave) by Ben Milton. I have used some cool public domain art curated by Nate Treme of [Highland Paranormal Society](https://www.patreon.com/HPS)

[Download the PDF](https://github.com/catnipped/knave-character-sheet/raw/master/knave%20character%20sheet%20(A4).pdf) or the [illustrator source file](https://github.com/catnipped/knave-character-sheet/raw/master/knave%20character%20sheet.ai) if you want to make your own variant. The fonts are: Sebaldus Gotisch, Vollkorn SC and Averia Serif Libre

**DO NOT SCALE** when printing the pdf. It already comes with enough margin for being printed on an A4. I've yet to do a Letter sized version as I'm stuck with european standards.

Enjoy!
