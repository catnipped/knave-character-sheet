# KNAVE Character Sheet

I made this character sheet for [Knave RPG](https://questingbeast.itch.io/knave) by Ben Milton. Download the [pdf](https://github.com/catnipped/knave-character-sheet/blob/master/knave%20character%20sheet.pdf) or the [illustrator source file](https://github.com/catnipped/knave-character-sheet/blob/master/knave%20character%20sheet.ai) if you want to make your own variant.

**DO NOT SCALE** when printing the pdf. It already comes with enough margin for being printed on an A4. I've yet to do a Letter sized version as I'm stuck with european standards.

Enjoy!
